                    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                        To repeat what was previously discussed in the previous portfolio, information systems (IS) are solutions that help gather, analyze, maintain, and distribute data. It consists of hardware, software, and various networks that are often used by people and organizations to streamline workflows and achieve business goals, essentially being the human-based backbone of an organization's system and its contents (UC Berkeley School of Information, 2025). In relation to IS, data and information are the same, in which the two can be thought of as input and output wherein data in for the forms of text, characters and numbers are retrieved from various sources and is translated, as it has yet to be processed or given context (University of Cambridge, 2017) and given meaning or importance as factual output that has relevance in a given setting; information is data that has meaning (University of Cambridge, 2017). There are 6 information system types; Transaction processing systems (TPS), Office automation systems (OAS), Knowledge management systems (KMS), Management support systems (MSS), Decision support systems (DSS), and Executive support systems (ESS). A transaction processing system (TPS) is used during a business transaction and manages the collection and retrieval of both customer and business data thereby storing it as information for future reference and  financial audits (Schneider & Smalley, 2025). This differs from Office automation systems (OAS), which are configurations of networked computer hardware and software applied to business and communication functions in the office level of companies and organizations like word processing, emailing, video-conferences and e-collaborations (Encyclopedia.com, 2025).<br> <br> The objective of Knowledge management systems (KMS) is to support creation, transfer, and application of knowledge within companies and organizations, these systems are often used by knowledge managers to build and maintain an accessible and secure database of information thus creating a strong and reliable foundation for various information. Management information systems (MIS) are used to determine immediate decisions based off of daily operations, the main functions within a company and organization and the results thereof, whilst decision support systems (DSS) are used to assist decision makers within the organization or company to solve often complex problems, identify and relate to trends, and providing alternative methods to approaching different situations by professionals and analysts as opposed to the low to middle-level managers of MIS. At the very top with the high level members of an organization or company are Executive support systems (ESS), which provide a variety of internal and external information to top managers in a highly summarized and convenient form, thus performing similarly to DSS with the exception of being less analytical in nature so as to easily display information deemed important allowing for swift interpretation and the decisiveness required to tackle high-level threats and situations.
