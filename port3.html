                        Numeral Systems in Computer Science refer to the numeric base systems used for performing computations, storing and representing data. The most common of these are the binary (base-2), decimal (base-10), octal (base-8), and hexadecimal (base-16) systems. (Numeral Systems: Binary, Decimal, Conversion | StudySmarter, 2023)

                        The Binary Number System is a type of numeral system using two digits; 0 and 1, with each digit’s place value being a power of 2 (e.g., 2^0, 2^1, 2^2). The Binary system is the foundation for data representation in computers and digital electronics. (GeeksforGeeks, 2025)

                    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                        The Decimal number system is the number system that we use on a daily basis based on the first 10 digits; 0-9.,  with each digit’s place value being a power of 10 (e.g., 10^0, 10^1, 10^2). We use the Decimal system regularly for counting and calculations. (Decimal Number System - Definition, Conversion, Examples, FAQs | CueMath , n.d.)

                        The Octal number system uses the first 8 digits; 0-7., with each digit’s place value being a power of 8 (e.g., 8^0, 8^1, 8^2) and is commonly used as a compact representation of binary numbers from the Binary number system. (GeeksforGeeks, 2025)

                        The Hexadecimal number system is one of the types of number systems along with binary, octal, and decimal. The base number of a hexadecimal number system is 16 where it includes both numbers from 0 - 9 and digits from A - F. Hexadecimal is considered as one of the most convenient ways to showcase a binary number in computers. (Hexadecimal Number System - Definition, Conversion, Examples, FAQs | CueMath, n.d.)

                        In computer science, the concept of Numeral Systems refers to the base systems of numbers that form the basis of digital representation, data storage, and computing (Numeral Systems: Binary, Decimal, Conversion | StudySmarter, 2023). Both humans and machines process and interpret data according to these systems. Binary (base-2), Decimal (base-10), Octal (base-8), and Hexadecimal (base-16) are the most widely used numeric systems. Each uses a different set of symbols and a different base value, both of which are essential to electronics, programming, and system architecture. Computer scientists and engineers can effectively handle data conversions and enhance digital communication procedures by having a thorough understanding of these systems. The foundation of computer processes is the Binary Number System, which consists only of the numbers 0 and 1, with each place denoting a power of two (GeeksforGeeks, 2025). The physical basis of digital circuits, which function through two voltage states—on and off—that mirror the binary digits, makes binary representation crucial.<br> <br>A power of ten is represented by each of the ten digits (0–9) that make up the Decimal Number System, the base-10 system that is utilized in daily life (Decimal Number System - Definition, Conversion, Examples, FAQs | CueMath, n.d.). Computers need to convert between decimal and binary for input and output operations, even though people naturally prefer decimals. The first eight digits (0–7) make up the Octal Number System, and place values are equivalent to powers of eight. By assembling bits into sets of three, it is frequently used to condense lengthy binary sequences into a compact representation of binary integers (GeeksforGeeks, 2025). In a similar manner, the Hexadecimal Number System, which represents four bits per digit and employs sixteen symbols (0–9 and A–F), functions as an effective shorthand for binary data. All things considered, numeral systems are essential to computer science because they give machines the foundation they need to efficiently understand, compute, and transmit data across digital systems.
