                        As a discipline, Computer Science (CS) seeks to build a scientific foundation for such topics as computer design, computer programming, information processing, algorithmic solutions of problems, and the algorithmic process itself (Brookshear et al., 2009). CS isn’t limited to just these topics but they serve as the fundamentals of various computer applications and infrastructure with endless development in multiple facets within different fields in order to enhance functionality and design. Computer science is one of five (5) different disciplines and majors, all of which are interconnected; Computer Science, Computer Engineering (CE), Information Technology, Information Systems, and Software Engineering. Computer Science delves into different elements such as algorithms, data structures, programming languages, computer architecture, and software development methodologies (What Is Computer Science? - University of Dundee, 2024), whereas Computer Engineering is the field of constructing and enhancing the foundations of computer hardware such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), storage and directories, motherboards, etc., which leads to various professions such as Hardware Engineering, Circuit Design Engineering, Software Engineering, Systems Engineering and more.<br> <br> Information Technology (IT) takes the software and structures developed by CS and are responsible for maintaining and handling the computers and software utilized in manipulating and keeping data securely, while Information Systems (IS) is generally the organizational, human-based processes and systems of handling said data to be turned into information as a whole. Some common offshoots of IS include Management information systems, Decision support systems, Knowledge management systems, Transaction processing systems, Office automation systems, and Executive support systems, all of which depend on user/person input in correspondence with their different organizations. Last but not least, Software Engineering (SE) involves the development and maintenance of software, and relies on different principles as well as programming languages in order to create and enhance software applications and programs for the intended users. SE is responsible for designing and developing video games, business applications, operating systems, network control systems, and middleware, and in hindsight is a practice offshooting from CS. Two different occupations stemming from being a Software Engineer are Application Engineering and System Engineering, both of which are rather self-explanatory.
